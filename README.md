# mv

_mv_ is a little music visualizer based on [ID3 tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3).

This project came about as Windows Media Player is not capturable in OBS, so this is a little streamers could use for something like WMP.

### Usage

Right now, _mv_ is a website. Go [here](https://atkascha.gg/mv)

- Click "Choose directoy" (a directory of mp3 files)
- The first song will start playing
- The shown is the one associated with the .mp3 file

### Commands

Volume Control: <kbd>↑</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd>

Song selection: <kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>→</kbd>

Pause/Play: <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd>

Mute: <kbd>m</kbd>
